# Arduino Westminster Chimes on Pezieo

A simple demo of playing Westminster Chimes with the built in tone method.

A quick dig around the Internet didn't turn up a ready to roll example of playing Westminster Chimes on an Arduino with a simple pezieo. I adapted a simple melody script based on the Arduino Tone code to play the chimes.

The playWestminsterChimes() method plays the tones. The playBong(int bongDurationMs) method plays a single bong of length bongDurationMs in milliseconds.
